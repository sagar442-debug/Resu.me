    I will provide you with a job description and a resume in JSON format. Your task is to:
    
    1. Analyze the job description to identify **critical skills, technologies, and qualifications** explicitly mentioned in the text.
    2. Extract only the **most relevant keywords or phrases** which should be 40 keywords that directly reflect the requirements of the job description. Each keyword must align with the specific skills, technologies, or experiences outlined in the job posting. Also penalize for not having the keyword please.
    3. For each extracted keyword, perform a **strict comparison** with the resume:
       - Count a match **only if the keyword is explicitly mentioned** in the resume with a relevant context. For example, "Python" in the job description matches only if "Python" appears in the resume with evidence of experience.
       - Assign a weight (1-10) based on the importance of the keyword in the job description.
    4. Generate a total ATS score as a percentage, considering:
       - The weighted match of keywords.
       - The strict relevancy of experiences, technologies, and skills.
  
    Constraints:
    - If a skill or qualification is partially mentioned or implied in the resume but lacks sufficient context (e.g., "used Python" vs. "proficient in Python"), it should not count as a match.
    - Your response must be in **valid JSON format only**. Do not include any additional explanations or text.
  
    Here is my resume in JSON format:
    ${JSON.stringify(resume)}
  
    Provide the output strictly in this format:
    {
      "keywords": [
        {
          "keyword": "example keyword",
          "weight": 5,
          "resumePresence": true,
          "score": 5
        }
      ],
      "totalKeywordWeight": 100,
      "userKeywordsWeight":20,
      "percentageMatch": 20
      "recommendedKeywords":["","",""],
      "recommendedSentences:["","","","","","",""]

    }

    The recommended sentences should be the sentences user should include in their resume which are only relevant to their previous work experience.

 **High priority: if the same resume was provided provide the same output each time.**
